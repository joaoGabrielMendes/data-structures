This repository contains simple implementations of core data structures in Go. It's designed to aid in learning Go and revisiting the theory of algorithms and data structures.

## Supported Data Structures

- Dynamic Array

## Supported Array Functions

- `Push`: Adds elements to the end of the array.
- `Pop`: Removes the last element from the array.
- `Shift`: Removes the first element from the array.
- `Unshift`: Adds elements to the beginning of the array.
- `Slice`: Extracts a section of the array.
- `Splice`: Adds or removes elements from the array at a specified index.
- `Map`: Applies a function to each element in the array.
- `ForEach`: Executes a provided function once for each array element.
